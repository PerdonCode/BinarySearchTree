# BinarySearchTree!


Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

Advantages of Binary search tree
Searching an element in the Binary search tree is easy as we always have a hint that which subtree has the desired element.
As compared to array and linked lists, insertion and deletion operations are faster in BST.
